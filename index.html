                    I’ve seen is my first dog, Yuki. Then I guess the second thing I see every day is my

                <h1>Phases of Your Life</h1>
                <p>I went through only childhood and teenager but soon I’ll be an early adult. 
                    Throughout the phases of my life, I’ve been focused on the values that my parents taught me and further till my teenage years, 
                    I am still navigating myself to find who I am and strive for the goals I want to achieve.</p>

                <h1>What Does My Life Mean? & Lessons I've Learned</h1>
                <p>In all honesty, I define life as a game that I play and choose the choices that build up my character. 
                    Ever since I was born, all I have wanted is to provide for my parents, make them proud, and help people 
                    who are in need. Lessons I've learned is that you can't always please everyone. 
                    Some people just can’t understand you, regardless of how hard I do something to please them.</p>

                    <h1>Successes and Highlights</h1>
                    <p>Most of my achievements are being able to be a top honors consecutively throughout elementary and high school. 
                        I became an amateur at certain talents such as illustration, teaching, coding, and writing, it's a huge achievement 
                        for me that I also won awards along with my talents. </p>

                    <p>I give tribute to my beloved family and my dog. My very close friends and all the mentors I’ve met and learned so much from. They helped me 
                        become the person I am today and I couldn’t be as grateful and give them the biggest tribute in shaping myself. </p>

                <h1>Family Background and Culture</h1>
                <p>I have two younger brothers and a mother and father. I grew up in a very open family, where I can give my thoughts and tell 
                    what happens to me regardless if it’s trivial. My family is very supportive of my future and I am taking advantage of all the lessons I’ve 
                    learned to push myself so that one day I can give back to them. The culture within my home is the typical Filipino family culture, yet being blooded into 
                    Japanese culture from my grandmother’s side, I also adopted certain cultures and values from them. </p>

                    <p>The saddest day was the time I was lost, I felt depressed when I lost someone very close to me. 
                        It was difficult accepting their presence in my life and it was difficult trying to get any clear thoughts that they were gone… 
                        It took two years to accept, move on, and give tribute to their life and how much they impacted me.

                <h1>Happiest Moments of My Life </h1>
                <p>I have always wanted a dog, though it was difficult to get one during my childhood due to my mother’s asthma. In 2023, I was finally able 
                    to own a dog, and it was the happiest day of my life as I was able to connect to such a bundle of joy. He is always the one I hug when I get 
                    home, and he greets me with a bark. He is currently a year old and very playful.
